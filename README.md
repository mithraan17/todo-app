To-Do App
Overview
This To-Do app is a simple React-based application designed to help users manage their tasks. The app includes basic functionalities such as adding, displaying, and removing to-do items. Additionally, it leverages localStorage to ensure the to-do list persists even after a page refresh.

Project Structure
1. App.js
The main component that initializes the app and manages the todos state.
Loads and saves the list of to-dos from/to localStorage to maintain persistence across page reloads.
Contains the addTodo and deleteTodo functions for adding and removing to-do items.
2. TodoForm.js
A component that provides an input field and button for users to add new to-do items.
Uses local state to manage user input and calls the addTodo function from App.js when a new task is submitted.
3. TodoItem.js
Represents an individual to-do item.
Displays the task along with a "Completed" button that triggers the deleteTodo function, removing the item from the list.
4. TodoList.js
Maps over the list of todos and renders a TodoItem for each one.
Displays a message when there are no to-do items, prompting the user to add new tasks.
Features
Add New Todos: Users can input a task and submit it to be added to the list.
Delete Todos: Each to-do item has a "Completed" button that removes it from the list.
Persistent Storage: To-do items are stored in localStorage, ensuring the list is saved even after a page refresh.
